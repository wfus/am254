# Compressed Sensing for Video Compression

In this repository I analyze compressed sensing for video compression. In these scripts I mostly try quantifying how much better using learned sensing matrices was compared to using random sensing matrices (The basis pursuit algorithm is usually analyzed by assuming the sensing matrix is sampled from a Gaussian).

I ran some experiments on MNIST and Cifar-100. The MATLAB scripts used (mostly for basis pursuit algorithms) can be found in `matlab/` and most of my results are available in `.mat` files in `matlab/data/`.
